# File Editor for Godot 4.0

***Unstable alpha.*** Backup files before using.

Aiming to make a nice code editor for use as either a standalone, or inside a game/program.

A continuation of [TextEditor](https://github.com/teebarjunk/Godot-TextEditor) for Godot3. (Which is better, and you should use instead, at the moment.)
